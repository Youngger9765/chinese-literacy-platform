"""
Lesson in-memory indexes: build and expose the singleton lesson collections.

Extracted from lesson_loader.py (Issue #1889).

Public API:
    build_all_lessons()  — load + merge + sort all lessons from both layers
    build_indexes()      — construct all lookup dicts from a lesson list

These are called once at module load time by lesson_loader.py (and directly
by tests that need to verify index construction in isolation).
